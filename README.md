# FastAPI Playground

This is a playground for [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).<br>
Most of the code is written by copilot. I personally cannot code without it anymore.<br>
This repo is a basically a playground for me to learn FastAPI and would be used in the [NFT-Backend](https://github.com/Dragonfly911117/NFT-Backend) project.<br>

# Environment setup
This thing is too simple to have a tutorial. <br> 
If you need one, just install PyCharm and have it do its magic.<br>
